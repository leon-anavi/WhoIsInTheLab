Hackafe Web Widget
==================
To use the widget you need to add this to your page:

```javascript
    <div id="hackafe-widget"></div>

    <script src="http://87.97.198.36/who/widget.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

The div will be populated with a list of all registered people currently in the lab.
